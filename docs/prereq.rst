==================
Preparing the host
==================
Now that you have successfully compiled and built binaries of each individual 
Cyclops components, let us understand how to properly install and configure 
them.

**Assumption: An Ubuntu 16.04 OS is installed on nodes where Cyclops framework services will be executed**

A few recommended housekeeping steps are receommended before actually starting 
with the individual service configurations.

Adding a dedicated user
-----------------------
Since cyclops services will be executed as system processes, it is highly 
recommended to create a dedicated user to execute these services.

::

  sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin cyclops

Optional softwares
------------------
As cyclops framework components generate extensive log messages, it is highly 
recommended to setup **logrotate** process to ensure log files do not consume 
the entire usable disk space.

**cURL** is used to setup RabbitMQ bindings for various Cyclops services later 
on. It is recommended to install it to avoid setup using the graphical 
interface.

System folders
--------------
Lets set up appropriate directories to place the binaries, configuration 
files, and log files.

::

  sudo mkdir -p /var/log/cyclops/
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/cyclops/
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/cyclops/
  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/cyclops/

We will move the compiled binaries into */usr/local/bin/cyclops/* subtree, 
configuration files under */etc/cyclops/* subtree, and the log files will be 
stored within */var/log/cyclops/* directory subtree. */var/lib/cyclops/* is 
used in case the services require a folder to store additional files.

Bootstrapping Postgresql
------------------------
Please use the following statements to allow Cyclops micro-services to setup 
service specific tables.

::

  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout='5min';"
  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "DROP USER IF EXISTS cyclops;"
  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER cyclops WITH PASSWORD 'pass1234';"
  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER cyclops CREATEDB;"
  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE cyclops;"
  sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cyclops TO cyclops;"

**Please set a reasonably strong password while creating a Cyclops DB user**

Configuring RabbitMQ
--------------------
Since Cyclops services uses RabbitMQ for inter-process communication, it is 
important that the messaging system is already preconfigured to enable 
communication.

::

  sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
  sudo rabbitmqctl add_user cyclops pass1234
  sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags cyclops administrator
  sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost cyclops
  sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p cyclops cyclops ".*" ".*" ".*"

**Please set a reasonably strong rabbitmq user password**

For sake of ease, we will continue using *pass1234* in subsequent pages, do 
replace it with the actual value that was used instead. Figure 1 shows the 
global exchange and queue bindings maps and relationship between various 
Cyclops framework services.

The above bindings will be setup part by part while setting up respective 
services. Follow through the guide for installing each service individually.
